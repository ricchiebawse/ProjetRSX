Summary

   RGP is a very simple protocol used to make several people play a

RFC 7321                         RGP                            May 2014


1. Purpose

   RGP is a simple protocol to organize game between several players
   and allow them to chat with another player, therefore was named
   the Referee Game Protocol or RGP.

   It uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). RGP should provide
   the users to play different games together such as 
   Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock, Puissance 4 or 2048.
   RGP manage the communication between clients (players) and server
   (referee). He can obviously manage several players at the same time,
   but also several simultaneous games.

2. Overview of the Protocol


   Any game begins with enough request (depends on the requisite amount
   of player for a specific game) of connection to the server.
   When the game begin, players take turns to make their moves, one 
   player at a time. When all the conditions have been met, the referee
   declare a winner or a draw, and the game ends.

3. Relation to other Protocols

   As mentioned RGP uses the Transmission Connection Protocol (TCP) to
   manage the game, and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) in order to
   allow players to chat with another one.


4. Client - Server Connection

   A client (player) connect to the server via TCP by entering the 
   server’s address and server’s port. For each connection with a 
   player, the referee holds the id of the player and his ip. Then, he
   creates a thread to communicate with this client.

5. Client - Client Connection

   A connected client can chat with an other connected clients due to
   the referee. At the beginning of each game, a player asks the 
   referee to send him the ip of the player he faces and his listening
   port, the referee sends him. Then, the player can send messages 
   via UDP to this other player who will gets the ip and the listening
   port of his opponent in order to be able to answer via UDP.

6. Playing the game

   In each turn, the referee sends several messages such as the current
   game board or the turn number via TCP to the player whose turn it is,
   and wait for his response (which will be the player’s move). When
   the referee did it for all the players, he updates the game board 
   and check if the game is over. If not, the referee throw a new turn.

7. Game over

   According to the game, the referee knows game over’s rules. And he
   check at each turn whether theses game over’s circumstances are 
   completed or not. If there are, the referee send to the players
   game results and ask to all of them if they would like to play
   again. 
   If enough players agree, a new game begin.
